1. **Text sizing**: Consistent scaling pattern (text-base → text-lg → text-xl)
2. **Spacing**: Reduced padding/margins on mobile (p-4 → p-6 → p-8)
3. **Layout**: Mobile-first stacking, then grid/flex on larger screens
4. **Touch targets**: Maintained minimum 44px touch targets
5. **Full-width elements**: Buttons and cards expand on mobile for easier interaction

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test on actual devices at these breakpoints:
   - Mobile: 320px, 375px, 414px
   - Tablet: 768px, 1024px
   - Desktop: 1280px, 1920px

2. Check for:
   - Text readability at all sizes
   - Touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
   - Horizontal scrolling (should be none)
   - Form input usability on mobile keyboards
   - Smooth scrolling behavior

3. Performance considerations:
   - Background decorations are sized appropriately
   - Animations are performant on mobile devices
   - Images are responsive and optimized
